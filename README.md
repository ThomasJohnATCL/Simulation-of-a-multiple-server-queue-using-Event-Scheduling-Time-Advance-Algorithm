# Simulation-of-a-multiple-server-queue-using-Event-Scheduling-Time-Advance-Algorithm
Discrete Event Simulation of a multi-server queue (Dump Truck loading and weighing) using Event Scheduling/Time-advance algorithm. The python code output a simulation table containing the state variables, Finite-Element-List(FEL), and cumulative statistics at each clock instants.
